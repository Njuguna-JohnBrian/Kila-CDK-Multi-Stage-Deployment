## Features

- Multi-stage AWS CDK deployment setup.
- Easily define and manage AWS resources for different environments.
- Provides a foundation for infrastructure-as-code (IaC) practices.
- Enables automated deployments with AWS CDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with this project, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- AWS CDK CLI installed.
- AWS CLI configured with the necessary credentials.
- TypeScript familiarity if you want to modify the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Njuguna-JohnBrian/Kila-CDK-Multi-Stage-Deployment.git
   cd Kila-CDK-Multi-Stage-Deployment
   ```
### 2. Install project dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
### 3. Define your AWS resources for each environment in the lib/ directory. You can create separate stacks for different stages (e.g., development, staging, production).

### 4. Deploy your infrastructure for a specific stage using the AWS CDK CLI. For example, to deploy the development environment:

### 5. Repeat the deployment process for other environments as needed.

# Project Structure

- __bin/__: The entry point for the CDK application.

- __lib/__: Contains AWS CDK stacks and constructs for different environments.

- __cdk.json__: CDK configuration file.

- __package.json__: Node.js project dependencies and scripts.

# Deployment

To deploy your AWS resources for a specific environment, use the AWS CDK CLI. For example, to deploy the development environment:
```bash
cdk deploy YourDevelopmentStack
```
Repeat this process for other environments as needed. This will create and manage your infrastructure in the specified AWS accounts and regions.
